## Abstract / Executive Summary

{A concise, one-paragraph summary of the entire project. Describe the problem, the solution you built, the key technologies used, and the final outcome. Write this last, but place it first.}

## Problem Statement

{ Who is the user? What pain point are you addressing? }

User Stories:
As a {user type}, I want to {goal} so that {benefit}.
As a {user type}, I want to {goal} so that {benefit}.


## System Architecture and Design

### High-Level Architecture

{ Provide a high-level diagram of the system. This should show the flow of data from source to destination. How does it help to solve your task? }

### Data Sources

{ Describe the data you are using. Where does it come from? Is it a public API, a database, a set of files? What is its format (JSON, CSV, etc.), velocity (batch/streaming), and approximate volume? }

### Data Model

{ Explain the relationships between different data entities. If using a NoSQL database, provide sample document structures. }
 
## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites
{ List all the software and accounts a user needs to have installed/configured before they can run your project. Be specific with versions. }

Python (version 3.9+)

Docker & Docker Compose

...

### Installation & Launch

{Provide clear, step-by-step instructions that a user can copy and paste into their terminal to get the project running. Start from git clone.}

Clone the repository:
```
git clone {your-repo-url}
cd {project-directory}
```


Configure Environment Variables:
```
cp .env.example .env
```
Then, edit the .env file with your credentials...

Build and Launch Containers:
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### Configuration Parameters
{ List all the environment variables or configuration parameters a user can modify to adapt the application's behavior. }

API_KEY: Your API key for accessing the external data source.
DATABASE_URL: The connection string for the primary database.
SPARK_MASTER_URL: The URL for the Spark master node.

## Limitations and Future Work

{ No project is perfect. Acknowledging its limitations shows maturity and critical thinking. }

Limitations:
* The current data source has a rate limit of 1000 requests per hour.
* The current process is batch-based and runs daily; it cannot handle real-time data.

Future Work:
* Integrate a second data source to enrich the analysis.
* Implement a streaming pipeline using Kafka and Spark Streaming to provide real-time analytics.
* Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster for better scalability.

## Conclusion

{ Briefly summarize the project's accomplishments. Reiterate the problem you solved and how your solution addresses it. End on a high note about what you learned or the project's potential. }
